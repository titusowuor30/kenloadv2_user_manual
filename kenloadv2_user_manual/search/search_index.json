This system is integrated with an IP cameras which takes the picture of the vehicle been weighed. The picture is then saved into a folder. The system also takes weight from Static Axle weigh-bridge, Weighing in Motion, Standard Weighing and Multi deck Weigh bridge. Once a vehicle has been weighed it is also stored in a data base. When the vehicle comes for weighing, the previous data recorded will automatically appear on the screen. This makes work a lot easier for the operators because they only have to change what needs to be changed, thus saving time. The KenLoad system can be web based on request therefore can be accessed anywhere by any device provided it is Internet enabled. The data accessible is up to date at any time, therefore on-line users on the web can access the currently weighed vehicle with its picture.
